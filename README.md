# Project Overview

In this project I was given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. Using [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/), I analyzed multiple aspects of the pre-existing application, including the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and then I wrote a number of test suites, testing the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation, that gives me the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within my codebase.

# How to Run

* You can open the page [here](http://patricko10.github.io/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader).

* If you want to run it on your local machine. Download and unzip all files to a local directory, and then open the index.html with your favorite browser.

* Either way the tests start automatically.
